## Problems Encountered & Solutions

 Problem: We could not use system "pause"
 Solution: We use cin.get() instead.

 Problem: Although we include class interfaces(hpp file) in Class Implementations(cpp files),we still fail to include class interfaces without class implementation in our main code.
 Solution: We just include class implementations(cpp file) in our main code
